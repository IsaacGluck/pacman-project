=====================
Isaac Gluck, Michael Lim

To Run
------------
Compile all the .java files and run MainFrame.
More levels can be added but they must fill the following requirements:

1. The data must be represented by a 19 by 29 grid seperated by commas (no spaces)

2. There must be 11's at all the corners

3. 1's and 11's are treated as fruits, 21 is a powerup, 2 is a wall, 0 is free space

4. Save and add to the array levels in Board.java --> {"exampleLevel.txt"}

5. Recompile and run again to play your level! 

Introduction
------------
This pacman game is a classic pacman game!
When you open the game, there are several options for the main menu:

* If you are playing this game for the first time and want to register as a player, enter your desired username and password and click **Register** button. Then using the data, log in to the game.

* If you want to play as a guest, click **Guest Play**. Your information *will not be stored*.

* If you want to resume your game, enter your username and password and click **Login**. Your previous level and high score will be shown

**IMPORTANT**

For your game to be safely saved, you *must* click **Main Menu** at the end of your game. It also takes a few seconds to record your data, so do not quit the java window right away.

How to Play
-----------
1. The main rule is simple: eat as many fruits as you can before you die.

2. If you eat fruits, each fruit gives you 1 point.

3. If you eat a super fruit, you turn invincible for a several seconds. While you are in super pacman mode, you may eat monsters to gain much extra points.

4. After your super mode is over, monster will regenerate in the screen.
